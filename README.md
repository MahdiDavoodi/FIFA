---> Version 1.1.2 finished. My To-do list for next version:

	1. Create a setting activity for changing the theme and language in runtime.
	2. Improve the performance of the app(For reading data and creating lists).
	3. Work with themes and make a better UI.
	4. Make this app really useful.(some options for users to create their league!) I mean how can anybody use this shit except you and your brother!
	5. Add edit option for match results.
	6. Support both portrait and landscape.
